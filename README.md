# Bi-pedal-robot
The main objective of this project is to make a bi-pedal robot. The tasks that the robot can do are dance
and sing, but unfortunately not very artistic. Tasks are controlled by 2 interrupts (next and standby).

This “humanoid” robot has 5 modes: 3 dances with each one having a Christmas carol; 2 other dances.

This robot only uses 2 (micro) servos per leg. This makes the robot easy to create, code and cheap to
make. This robot can be made as a beginner’s robot to introduce yourself to the field of robotics. Other
components of this robot are: one speaker and two buttons (one for standby and other for the next
performance)
